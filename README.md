# VOLUME BOT V2 and Support:
Join my discord for support and a bunch of cool tools like jito pool bundling scripts, VOLUME BOT V2, maker bots, any other cool stuff for token launches :)

# Intructions:

1. yarn install/npm i

2. edit config.ts rpc.

3. when running the script for the first time make sure to fund the keypairs after you create them, the public keys of every keypair you make is saved under keyInfo.json for simplicity of the user.

4. send WSOL to your keypairs (WSOL!!!!)

5. to run use: npm run bot

NOTE: if the wallet popup is annoying and you will use the same keypairs always, comment out :178 in bot.ts
ALSO NOTE: to set different buy amounts, send different amounts of WSOL to your keypairs
